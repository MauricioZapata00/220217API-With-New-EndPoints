# My cloned API from edgarsofka with new EndPoints

This is my personal cloned API of a Restful service created with spring boot.
This API has the next changes:
1. **Eliminate a tutorial using the title**
![DELETE_Tutorial](images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202022-02-17%2019-53-44.png)
2. **Update a tutorial using the title**
![UPDATE_Tutorial](images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202022-02-17%2019-49-48.png)
3. **Get all the tutorials by the tutorial's price**
![GET_Tutorial_Using_Price](images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%20de%202022-02-17%2019-52-24.png)

As you can see, there are pictures above which shows the functionality of the API with the new endpoints.

The comments are made in spanish because I got frustrated trying to Debug my program, but the fact was that everything was good, and I was sending bad the requests and the bodies in Postman :joy: :joy: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
